# MSP 430 Toy

Hi! This repo is for the MSP430 with the EduKit BoosterPack V3. With this code you'll be able to play 4 songs with 4 buttons and make awesome patterns with the leds.


## Usage

Leave either button S1, S2, S3, S4 pressed to hear the song. Every song will make a different pattern with the leds. The songs that will be played are Old Macdonald, I Love You, Jingle Bells, and Twinkle Star. Moreover, each song was tuned to be faster or slower.

This project was done for Computer Architecture at The University of Texas at El Paso.
